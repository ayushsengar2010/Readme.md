## 🗣️ Why This Works

- **Clear structure and hierarchy**: Clean headers help recruiters and collaborators scan quickly.
- **Highlighted projects**: Includes quick snapshots with links to live demos and repositories.
- **Live stats**: Automated GitHub stats reflect consistent activity and encourage engagement—highly recommended by many devs :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.
- **Minimalist design**: Avoid clutter, too many badges or animations, which can distract from core content :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.

### ✅ Next Steps to Make It Shine

1. Create a new public repository named **`ayushsengar2010`** (exact match with your GitHub username). Place the above as **README.md** to make it visible on your profile.
2. Use tools like **GitHub Profile README Generator** by rahuldkjain to add visually clean badges, visitor counter, and stats easily :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.
3. Add GitHub Actions like **readme-stats**, **streak-stats**, or WakaTime integration to keep content dynamic.
4. Update your **“Projects”** and **“Contact”** sections as you build more.
